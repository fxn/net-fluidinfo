=head1 NAME

Net::Fluidinfo::ACL - A common ancestor for classes that provide an ACL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 $permission->policy('open');
 my $exceptions = $permission->exceptions;
 
 $permission->is_open;
 $permission->is_closed;
 $permission->has_exceptions;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Net::Fluidinfo::ACL> is a parent class of L<Net::Fluidinfo::Permission>.

You don't usually need this class, only the interface its children inherit.

=head1 USAGE

=head2 Instance Methods

=over

=item $acl->policy

=item $acl->policy('open'|'closed')

Sets/gets the policy, which must be either 'open' or 'closed'.

=item $acl->exceptions

=item $acl->exceptions($exceptions)

Gets/sets the exception list of this ACL, which is a possibly empty arrayref of usernames.
In Fluidinfo this is a set, so don't rely on the order of the elements.

=item $acl->is_open

Checks whether the ACL is open.

=item $acl->is_closed

Checks whether the ACL is closed.

=item $acl->has_exceptions

Checks whether the ACL has any exception.
